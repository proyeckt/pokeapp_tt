# 🚀 PokéApp – Technical Test - Global66

A production-ready Flutter mobile app created for the Global66 technical test. This project demonstrates my approach to clean architecture, reactive state management, API integration, and modern UI/UX with Material Design.

---

## ✅ Overview

This app showcases a well-structured Flutter codebase, focusing on:

- Modern framework standards
- Architectural clarity and maintainability
- Detailed reasoning about technical choices
- Secure, extensible code ready for production

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- **Flutter SDK 3.10+**
- **Dart 3.0+**
- Compatible IDE (VS Code, Android Studio, etc.)
- Android/iOS emulator or device

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles for maintainability and scalability:

- **Presentation Layer**:  
- Widgets and feature-based UI modules
- Material Design conformity
- Navigation with GoRouter

- **State Management**:  
- **Riverpod + Annotations** for reactive, typed state
- Clean separation of logic from UI

- **Domain & Data Layers**:  
- **Freezed** for immutable models, simple yet powerful
- **Dio** for all network operations

---

## 🤖 Usage of AI

AI tools were used strictly for **assistance** in:

- Generating boilerplate documentation and README
- Explaining architecture and code structure
- Suggesting clean UI patterns and best practices
- Reviewing non-sensitive code for clarity

---

## 🔒 Security Measures

- **All API calls are HTTPS**
- **Dio interceptors** for response and error validation
- **State protection** with Riverpod to prevent data leaks
- **Access control** and user input validation
- **Material Design** for phishing-resistant UI

---

## 💡 Choice Summary

- **Flutter/Dart**: Proven stability and ecosystem for mobile apps.
- **Riverpod with annotations**: Type-safe, easy-to-maintain state without boilerplate.
- **Freezed**: Model immutability, easy-to-use data classes, built-in `copyWith` and serialization.
- **Clean Architecture**: Decoupled, testable, scalable layers.
- **Material Design**: Consistent, modern, accessible UI.
